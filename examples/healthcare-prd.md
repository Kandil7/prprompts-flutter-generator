# HealthTrack Pro - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

HealthTrack Pro is a HIPAA-compliant mobile health platform enabling patients to manage chronic conditions, communicate securely with healthcare providers, and participate in telemedicine consultations. Targeting 10,000 active patients within 6 months of launch, the app addresses the growing need for remote patient monitoring and virtual care delivery.
