# Fintech App Template
# PCI-DSS compliant financial services application

## Project Description
A secure financial services application for payments, transactions, and account management.

## Target Users
- Individual consumers (personal banking)
- Business users (B2B payments, invoicing)
- Financial advisors (portfolio management)
- Merchants (accepting payments)

## Core Features
1. **Account Management** - View balances, transactions, statements
2. **Payments & Transfers** - Send money, pay bills, P2P transfers
3. **Card Management** - Virtual cards, freeze/unfreeze, limits
4. **Investment Tracking** - Portfolio view, market data, alerts
5. **Security Features** - 2FA, biometric auth, fraud detection

## Compliance Requirements
- PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley) for public companies
- GDPR (if serving EU users)
- AML/KYC (Anti-Money Laundering / Know Your Customer)
- Local financial regulations (varies by region)

## Security Requirements
- **NEVER store credit card numbers** - Use tokenization
- TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required
- Biometric authentication recommended
- JWT RS256 for API authentication
- Payment tokenization (Stripe, PayPal, Braintree)
- Fraud detection and monitoring
- Session timeout (5-15 minutes idle)

## Technical Stack
- **Platforms**: iOS, Android, Web
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture + BLoC
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 / JWT RS256
- **State Management**: BLoC
- **Backend**: REST API (Node.js, Java Spring recommended)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with encryption
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe, PayPal, Adyen (PCI-DSS compliant)
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for market data, notifications

## Data Types
- Payment information (tokenized only!)

- Market data providers
- Credit bureaus

## Testing Requirements
- PCI-DSS compliance audit
- Penetration testing (required quarterly)
- Payment flow testing (sandbox environments)

- Disaster recovery testing
- Security code review (required for all payment code)

## Code Review Requirements
- **2+ senior developers** must approve payment-related code
- Security team review for authentication changes
- Compliance team review for regulatory features

## Deployment Considerations
- PCI-DSS compliant hosting (Level 1 certified)
- SAQ (Self-Assessment Questionnaire) completion
- Network segmentation (payment processing isolated)
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- DDoS protection
- 24/7 monitoring and alerting
- Incident response plan

## Demo Requirements
- **Test accounts and cards ONLY**
- Clearly labeled "DEMO" or "SANDBOX"
- No real financial data
