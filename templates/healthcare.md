# Healthcare App Template
# HIPAA-compliant medical application

## Project Description
A HIPAA-compliant healthcare application for managing patient data and secure communication.

## Target Users
- Healthcare providers (doctors, nurses, clinicians)
- Patients (accessing their health records)
- Administrative staff (managing appointments, billing)

## Core Features
1. **Patient Portal** - Secure access to health records
2. **Secure Messaging** - HIPAA-compliant communication with providers
3. **Appointment Management** - Schedule and manage appointments
4. **Medication Tracking** - Track prescriptions and adherence
5. **Health Data Sync** - Integration with wearables and health devices

## Compliance Requirements
- HIPAA (Protected Health Information)
- GDPR (if serving EU users)
- FDA regulations (if medical device features)

## Security Requirements
- End-to-end encryption for messaging
- AES-256-GCM encryption at rest for PHI
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- JWT RS256 with public key verification only
- Biometric authentication required
- Audit logging for all PHI access

## Technical Stack
- **Platforms**: iOS, Android
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture + BLoC
- **Authentication**: JWT with RS256
- **State Management**: BLoC
- **Backend**: REST API (Node.js recommended)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with encryption
- **Storage**: AES-256-GCM encrypted local storage

## Data Types
- Protected Health Information (PHI)
- Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Medical records
- Appointment data
- Prescription information

## Team Recommendations
- **Required**: Security consultant (HIPAA compliance)
- **Required**: Healthcare domain expert
- **Recommended**: Privacy officer
- Team size: Medium to Large (6-20 developers)

## Integration Points
- EHR/EMR systems (HL7, FHIR)
- Pharmacy systems
- Lab systems
- Insurance verification APIs
- Payment processing (PCI-DSS compliant)

## Testing Requirements
- Security testing (penetration testing)
- HIPAA compliance audit
- End-to-end encryption verification
- Access control testing
- Audit log verification
- Performance testing (HIPAA-compliant reporting)

## Deployment Considerations
- HIPAA-compliant hosting (AWS HIPAA, Google Cloud Healthcare API)
- Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with cloud provider
- Data residency requirements
- Disaster recovery plan
- Incident response plan

## Demo Requirements
- **Synthetic data ONLY** - Never use real PHI
- Demo environment completely isolated
- Basic auth protection for demo
- Clear watermarks indicating demo environment
