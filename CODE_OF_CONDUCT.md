# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being patient with newcomers and those learning
* Helping others when possible and sharing knowledge freely
* Celebrating others' successes and contributions

* Public or private harassment

* Dismissing or attacking inclusion-oriented requests
* Sustained disruption of community discussions
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting
* Repeatedly contacting someone after being asked to stop
* Pattern of making others uncomfortable through actions or words

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to actions taken outside of these spaces when
they have a reasonable impact on community safety and well-being.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**Email:** [Project maintainer contact - to be added]

Alternatively, you can report issues by:
- Opening a private security advisory on GitHub
- Contacting project maintainers directly through GitHub

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

### Confidentiality

All reports will be handled with discretion. We understand that reporting can be
difficult and we will respect your privacy.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Reporting Process

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns,
please report it by following these steps:

1. **Collect Information**: Note what happened, when, where, and who was involved
2. **Choose Reporting Method**:
   - Email community leaders (preferred for serious issues)
   - Open a private security advisory on GitHub
   - Contact maintainers directly
3. **Provide Details**: Include as much information as possible
4. **Follow Up**: Community leaders will respond within 48 hours

- Any additional information that may be helpful

## Our Responsibilities

### Community Leaders Will:

- Maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident
- Respond to reports promptly (within 48 hours)
- Investigate thoroughly and fairly

### Community Leaders Will Not:

- Retaliate against good-faith reporters

## PRPROMPTS-Specific Guidelines

### Technical Discussions

- **Be Constructive**: When reviewing code or providing feedback, focus on the
  code, not the person

- **Share Knowledge**: If you know a better way, share it kindly
- **Acknowledge Expertise**: Recognize when others have more experience in an area

### Issue and Pull Request Etiquette

- **Search First**: Before opening an issue, search to avoid duplicates
- **Be Patient**: Maintainers are volunteers; responses may take time

  disagree, but do so respectfully
