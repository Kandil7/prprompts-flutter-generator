## Main Post (Professional Tone)

**Revolutionizing Flutter Development: PRPROMPTS v4.4.3 - Complete Multi-AI Command Parity** ðŸš€

After achieving perfect command parity across all AI platforms, I'm excited to announce PRPROMPTS v4.4.3 - an AI-powered Flutter development framework that reduces development time from weeks to hours, now with **ALL 21 commands working identically** on Claude, Qwen, and Gemini.

**The Challenge We Solved:**

Traditional Flutter development requires extensive manual work:
- 2-3 weeks to set up proper architecture
- Manual implementation of security patterns
- Repetitive compliance configurations (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR)
- Inconsistent code quality across teams
- Limited automation in the development workflow

**Our Solution:**

PRPROMPTS v4.4.3 introduces a comprehensive automation system with **perfect multi-AI parity**:

**1. Intelligent PRD Creation (6 Commands)**
- `/prd:create` - Interactive wizard with industry templates (Healthcare, Fintech, Education, E-commerce, Logistics, SaaS)
- `/prd:auto-generate` - AI-assisted auto-generation from descriptions
- `/prd:from-files` - Multi-file aggregation for complex projects
- `/prd:auto-from-project` - Auto-discover all project markdown files
- `/prd:analyze` - Quality scoring with A-F grades and AI confidence levels
- `/prd:refine` - Interactive quality improvement loop

**2. Strategic Planning Tools (4 Commands)**
- `/planning:estimate-cost` - Comprehensive cost breakdown (labor, infrastructure, compliance)
- `/planning:analyze-dependencies` - Feature dependencies and critical path mapping
- `/planning:stakeholder-review` - Role-specific PRD review checklists
- `/planning:implementation-plan` - Sprint-based planning with velocity tracking

**3. 32 Security-Audited Development Guides (5 Generators)**
Each guide follows our PRP (Purpose â†’ Requirements â†’ Prompt â†’ Response â†’ Validation) pattern, ensuring:
- Consistent architecture (Clean Architecture + BLoC)
- Built-in security compliance
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure
- Production-ready code from day one

Generation commands:
- `/prprompts:generate-all` - All 32 PRPROMPTS files
- `/prprompts:phase-1` - Phase 1: Core Architecture (10 files)
- `/prprompts:phase-2` - Phase 2: Quality & Security (12 files)
- `/prprompts:phase-3` - Phase 3: Demo & Learning (10 files)
- `/prprompts:single-file` - Generate single file by name

**4. Full Automation Pipeline (6 Commands)**
- `/automation:bootstrap` - Complete project structure in 2 minutes
- `/automation:implement-next` - AI-driven feature implementation (10 min)
- `/automation:update-plan` - Adaptive re-planning based on velocity (30 sec)
- `/automation:full-cycle` - End-to-end multi-feature development (1-2 hours)
- `/automation:review-commit` - Automated code review and Git integration
- `/automation:qa-check` - Comprehensive quality and compliance audit

**Total: 21 Commands + 8 Skills = 29 Slash Commands**

**Multi-AI Support - Perfect Command Parity:**

PRPROMPTS v4.4.3 works seamlessly with three leading AI platforms with **identical functionality**:

ðŸ”µ **Claude Code** - Production-quality implementation (9.5/10 accuracy)
ðŸŸ  **Qwen Code** - Extended context for large projects (256K-1M tokens)
ðŸŸ¢ **Gemini CLI** - Generous free tier for rapid prototyping (60 req/min)

**What's New in v4.4.3:**
- âœ… All 21 commands now visible in Qwen Code and Gemini CLI
- âœ… Auto-generated TOML command files for perfect parity
- âœ… Enhanced documentation with complete command reference
- âœ… Fixed command count from 20 to 21 across all platforms
- âœ… All extensions install automatically via npm

**Real-World Impact:**

- **Time Savings**: 40-60x faster development (weeks â†’ 2-3 hours)
- **Security-First**: 6 compliance frameworks built-in (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR, SOC2, COPPA, FERPA)
- **Quality**: Automated testing, code review, and QA checks
- **Consistency**: Same architecture across all projects
- **AI Flexibility**: Choose your AI by power/cost, not by features

**Getting Started:**

```bash
npm install -g prprompts-flutter-generator@4.4.3
prprompts create      # Create your PRD
prprompts generate    # Generate 32 development guides
```

Then use **ANY** of the 21 commands in Claude/Qwen/Gemini!

**Technical Architecture:**

- Clean Architecture with BLoC pattern
- Comprehensive test coverage setup (85%+ unit, 75%+ widget)
- API integration scaffolding (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)
- Analytics and monitoring infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Environment management (dev, staging, prod, demo)
- Flutter flavors support
- Security-audited patterns for all compliance frameworks

## Technical Deep-Dive Post

**Title:** "Achieving Perfect Multi-AI Command Parity: The PRPROMPTS v4.4.3 Story"

**Content:**

**The Challenge:**
Supporting 3 different AI assistants (Claude, Qwen, Gemini) with identical functionality is hard. Each has different:
- Command file formats (.md vs .toml)
- Extension systems
- Configuration approaches

**The Solution:**
v4.4.3 introduces auto-generated TOML files:

1. **Source of Truth**: Markdown .md files (human-readable)
2. **Auto-Generation**: Scripts convert .md â†’ .toml for Qwen/Gemini
3. **Installation**: Postinstall script generates TOML files automatically
4. **Result**: ALL 21 commands work identically across all 3 AIs

**Technical Implementation:**
- `generate-qwen-command-toml.js` - Converts 21 .md â†’ .toml
- `generate-gemini-command-toml.js` - Same for Gemini
- `scripts/postinstall.js` - Automated generation on npm install

**Impact:**
- Users choose AI by power/cost, not by features
- 29 total slash commands (21 + 8 skills) everywhere
- Zero configuration needed
- Perfect parity maintained automatically

## Comments & Responses Template

**When someone asks about specific AI:**
"Great question! All 21 commands work identically across Claude Code, Qwen Code, and Gemini CLI. Choose based on your needs:
- Claude: Best for production quality (9.5/10 accuracy)
- Qwen: Best for large projects (256K-1M context)
- Gemini: Best for rapid prototyping (60 req/min free tier)

The v4.4.3 TOML fix ensures perfect parity!"

**When someone asks about getting started:**
"Super easy! Just run:
```
npm install -g prprompts-flutter-generator@4.4.3
prprompts create
prprompts generate
```

Then all 29 slash commands are available in your AI of choice. Full guide: [GitHub link]"

**When someone asks about specific compliance:**
"PRPROMPTS v4.4.3 includes built-in patterns for 6 compliance frameworks:
- HIPAA (Healthcare)
- PCI-DSS (Payments) - NEVER store card numbers, use tokenization
- GDPR (Privacy)
- SOC2 (Enterprise)
- COPPA (Children's apps)
- FERPA (Education)

Each PRPROMPTS file adapts to your PRD's compliance requirements automatically. Which framework are you working with?"
