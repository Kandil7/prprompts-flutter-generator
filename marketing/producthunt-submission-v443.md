---

## Full Description

### The Problem
Traditional Flutter development is painfully slow:
- 2-3 weeks just for project setup and architecture
- Manual security implementation
- Repetitive boilerplate code
- Compliance headaches (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR)
- Inconsistent code quality
- **Fragmented AI tools** - different features on different platforms

### The Solution
PRPROMPTS v4.4.3 is an AI-powered development framework that reduces Flutter development time from weeks to hours through intelligent automation.

**NEW in v4.4.3:** **Perfect Multi-AI Command Parity** - ALL 21 commands now work identically across Claude Code, Qwen Code, and Gemini CLI! Choose your AI by power/cost, not by features.

### How It Works

**1. PRD Creation (2 minutes)**
Create your Product Requirements Document using **6 approaches**:
- `/prd:create` - Interactive wizard with 6 industry templates
- `/prd:auto-generate` - AI generates from description
- `/prd:from-files` - Multi-file aggregation
- `/prd:auto-from-project` - Auto-discover project markdown files
- `/prd:analyze` - Quality scoring with A-F grades
- `/prd:refine` - Interactive quality improvement loop

**Industry Templates:** Healthcare, Fintech, Education, E-commerce, Logistics, SaaS

**2. Strategic Planning (4 commands)**
NEW enterprise planning capabilities:
- `/planning:estimate-cost` - Labor, infrastructure, compliance costs
- `/planning:analyze-dependencies` - Feature dependencies & critical path
- `/planning:stakeholder-review` - Role-specific review checklists
- `/planning:implementation-plan` - Sprint planning with velocity tracking

**3. PRPROMPTS Generation (instant - 5 commands)**
Automatically generates 32 development guides covering:
- `/prprompts:generate-all` - All 32 files
- `/prprompts:phase-1` - Core Architecture (10 files)
- `/prprompts:phase-2` - Quality & Security (12 files)
- `/prprompts:phase-3` - Demo & Learning (10 files)
- `/prprompts:single-file` - Single file by name

**4. Full Automation Pipeline (6 commands)**
Zero-touch development:
- `/automation:bootstrap` - Complete project structure (2 min)
- `/automation:implement-next` - AI implements next feature (10 min)
- `/automation:update-plan` - Adaptive re-planning (30 sec)
- `/automation:full-cycle` - Auto-implement 1-10 features (1-2 hours)
- `/automation:review-commit` - Validate & commit changes

Hey Product Hunt! üëã

I'm excited to launch PRPROMPTS v4.4.3 today - **with a major achievement: perfect multi-AI command parity!**

**The Story:**

I built this because I was tired of spending 2-3 weeks setting up Flutter projects with proper architecture, security, and compliance before I could start building actual features.

PRPROMPTS started as a personal tool to generate development guides. With v4.0, it became a complete automation framework. **With v4.4.3, I achieved something I'm really proud of: ALL 21 commands now work identically across Claude Code, Qwen Code, and Gemini CLI!**

**The v4.4.3 Breakthrough:**

Before v4.4.3, Qwen Code and Gemini CLI only showed the 8 skills, not the 21 regular commands. The problem? Each AI required different command file formats (.md vs .toml).

**The solution:** Auto-generated TOML files from markdown sources during npm install. Now all platforms show all 29 slash commands identically.

**Impact:** Choose your AI based on what matters to YOU:
- Claude: Best accuracy (9.5/10) for production apps
- Qwen: Best context (256K-1M tokens) for large projects
- Gemini: Best free tier (60 req/min) for rapid prototyping

**NOT based on which features are available!**

**What Makes It Special:**

1. **Perfect Multi-AI Parity**: 21 commands + 8 skills work everywhere. No fragmentation.

2. **Security-First**: Every guide includes compliance patterns (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR, SOC2, COPPA, FERPA). No more "we'll add security later."

3. **Industry Templates**: 6 pre-configured templates (Healthcare, Fintech, Education, E-commerce, Logistics, SaaS) with domain-specific compliance and features.

4. **Real Automation**: Not just boilerplate generation - actually implements features with:
   - Complete Clean Architecture structure
   - BLoC state management
   - 85%+ unit test coverage
   - 75%+ widget test coverage
   - Security patterns built-in
   - Compliance validation

5. **Open Source**: MIT licensed. Community-driven. Extensible.

**Real Example:**

Last week, I built a healthcare app with patient records, appointments, and billing:
- Setup: 2 minutes (`/automation:bootstrap`)
- Patient records: 15 minutes (`/automation:implement-next`)
- Appointments: 10 minutes (`/automation:implement-next`)
- Secure messaging: 12 minutes (`/automation:implement-next`)
- Billing (PCI-DSS): 15 minutes (`/automation:implement-next`)
- Additional features: 60 minutes (`/automation:full-cycle`)

**Total: ~2 hours for a production-ready, HIPAA & PCI-DSS compliant healthcare app.**

Previously, this would have taken 3-4 weeks.

**Worked perfectly on all 3 AI platforms** - I tested on Claude, Qwen, AND Gemini!

**What I'm Looking For:**

- **Feedback** on the multi-AI parity approach
- **Bug reports** (it's open source, contributions welcome!)
- **Use cases** I haven't thought of
- **Compliance frameworks** you need (thinking of adding FDA, CCPA, ISO 27001)
- **Which AI you prefer** and why (Claude vs Qwen vs Gemini)

**Special Offer:**

It's free and open source, so... just try it! üòÑ

```bash
npm install -g prprompts-flutter-generator@4.4.3
prprompts create      # Choose Healthcare template for fastest start
prprompts generate    # Generates 32 guides instantly
```

Then all 29 slash commands are ready in Claude/Qwen/Gemini!

Happy to answer any questions!

P.S. - If you try it, please share:
1. What you built
2. Which AI you used (Claude/Qwen/Gemini)
3. How the multi-AI parity worked for you

Let's build the future of AI-assisted development together! üöÄ

## FAQ Responses (Pre-prepared)

**Q: How is this different from code generators like Flutter CLI?**
A: Flutter CLI creates boilerplate. PRPROMPTS creates 32 comprehensive guides AND automates implementation through AI with 29 slash commands. Plus, it works identically across 3 different AI platforms - Claude, Qwen, and Gemini!

**Q: Does the generated code actually work?**
A: Yes! I've tested extensively with all 3 AI platforms. But you should always review and test for your specific needs. The guides follow best practices, include 85%+ test coverage, and have security patterns built-in.

**Q: What if I don't use AI assistants?**
A: The 32 PRPROMPTS work great as development guides even without AI. The automation is optional - you can implement manually using the guides.

**Q: Which AI should I use - Claude, Qwen, or Gemini?**
A: **Great news - all 21 commands work identically!** Choose based on your needs:
- Claude Code: Best accuracy (9.5/10) for production apps
- Qwen Code: Best context (256K-1M tokens) for large projects
- Gemini CLI: Best free tier (60 req/min) for rapid prototyping

You can even switch between them mid-project!

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: The framework generates production-ready code structures with Clean Architecture, BLoC, tests, and security patterns. But you should always conduct proper testing and security audits for your specific use case.

**Q: How did you achieve multi-AI parity?**
A: Auto-generated TOML command files from markdown sources during npm install. Qwen/Gemini require .toml format, Claude uses .md. Scripts convert automatically for zero-config parity. See `scripts/generate-qwen-command-toml.js` in the repo!

**Q: How do you make money from this?**
A: Currently, I don't. It's open source (MIT). Future plans might include enterprise support, training, or premium features, but the core will always be free.

**Q: Can I contribute?**
A: Absolutely! It's open source. See CONTRIBUTING.md in the repo. Especially interested in:
- New PRPROMPTS for specific features
- Additional compliance frameworks
- More industry templates
- Bug fixes and improvements

**Q: Can I use my own AI assistant (not Claude/Qwen/Gemini)?**
A: Currently supports those 3. But the architecture is extensible - you could add support for other AIs. Check DEVELOPMENT.md for guidance on adding new AI platforms.

**Q: What's the difference between the 21 commands and 8 skills?**
A: **21 regular commands** are organized by category (/prd:create, /automation:bootstrap). **8 skills** are interactive workflows for specific automation tasks. Total: **29 slash commands** working identically across all 3 AI platforms.
