# PRPROMPTS v4.0 Reddit Announcement

## Post for r/FlutterDev

**Title:** [Tool] PRPROMPTS v4.0 - AI-Powered Flutter Development: From 3 Weeks to 3 Hours

**Flair:** Tool/Package

**Body:**

Hey r/FlutterDev! üëã

I've been working on solving a problem that I (and probably many of you) face constantly: the massive time sink of setting up Flutter projects with proper architecture, security, and compliance.

## TL;DR

**PRPROMPTS v4.0** is an AI-powered development framework that:
- ‚ö° Reduces setup time from weeks to hours (40-60x faster)
- üîí Includes 6 compliance frameworks (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR, etc.)
- ü§ñ Works with Claude Code, Qwen Code, and Gemini CLI
- üèóÔ∏è Generates Clean Architecture + BLoC structure automatically
- üì¶ Available on npm: `npm install -g prprompts-flutter-generator`
- üÜì 100% open source (MIT licensed)

**GitHub:** https://github.com/Kandil7/prprompts-flutter-generator

## The Problem

How many times have you done this?

1. Create new Flutter project
2. Set up folder structure (features, core, shared...)
3. Add dependencies (BLoC, dio, get_it, etc.)
4. Configure state management
5. Create base classes and interfaces
6. Set up error handling
7. Add analytics and logging
8. Implement security patterns
9. Write tests
10. Finally start building actual features

**Result:** 2-3 weeks before you write your first real feature.

Sound familiar?

## The Solution

PRPROMPTS uses a 3-layer approach:

### 1. PRD Creation Layer
Four ways to create your Product Requirements Document:
- `prprompts create` - Interactive wizard
- `prprompts auto` - AI generates from description
- `prprompts from-files` - Aggregate from existing docs
- `prprompts manual` - Create yourself

### 2. 32 PRPROMPTS Generator
Runs `prprompts generate` to create 32 development guides covering:
- Architecture setup (Clean + BLoC)
- Feature implementation
- State management patterns
- API integration
- Testing strategies
- Security & compliance (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR, SOC2, COPPA, FERPA)
- Performance optimization
- And more...

Each guide follows the **PRP Pattern**:
- Purpose - What it achieves
- Requirements - What you need
- Prompt - Detailed instructions for AI
- Response Structure - Expected output
- Validation - How to verify
- Notes - Additional context

### 3. v4.0 Automation Pipeline (NEW!)
Use these commands in Claude/Qwen/Gemini:

**`/prp-bootstrap-from-prprompts`**
- Creates complete project structure
- Sets up all dependencies
- Configures architecture
- Time: ~5-10 minutes

**`/prp-implement-next`**
- AI implements next feature from PRD
- Includes tests and documentation
- Follows Clean Architecture patterns

**`/prp-full-cycle`**
- Complete feature from scratch
- Backend + Frontend + Tests
- Ready for production

**`/prp-review-and-commit`**
- Automated code review
- Git commit with proper message
- Suggests improvements

**`/prp-qa-check`**
- Comprehensive quality analysis
- Security audit
- Performance check

## Real Example

Here's a real timeline from my healthcare app:

**Traditional approach:**
- Day 1-2: Project setup
- Day 3-7: Architecture (Clean + BLoC)
- Day 8-14: Security & HIPAA compliance
- Day 15+: Start building features
- **Total: 3+ weeks**

**With PRPROMPTS:**
- Minute 0-2: `prprompts create` (Healthcare app PRD)
- Minute 2-3: `prprompts generate` (32 guides generated)
- Minute 3-15: `/prp-bootstrap-from-prprompts` (Complete structure)
- Minute 15-60: `/prp-full-cycle` for patient records feature
- **Total: ~1 hour for production-ready app with HIPAA compliance**

Yes, seriously. 1 hour vs 3 weeks.

## AI Platform Support

Works seamlessly with:

**üîµ Claude Code** (Anthropic)
- Best for: Production quality
- Accuracy: 9.5/10
- Context: 200K tokens

**üü† Qwen Code** (Alibaba)
- Best for: Large projects
- Context: 256K-1M tokens
- Great for complex apps

**üü¢ Gemini CLI** (Google)
- Best for: Rapid prototyping
- Free tier: 60 requests/min
- Good balance of speed/quality

All extensions install automatically via `npm install`.

---

## Security & Compliance

Every PRPROMPTS includes patterns for:

- ‚úÖ **HIPAA** - Healthcare apps
- ‚úÖ **PCI-DSS** - Payment processing
- ‚úÖ **GDPR** - EU privacy
- ‚úÖ **SOC2** - Enterprise security
- ‚úÖ **COPPA** - Children's apps
- ‚úÖ **FERPA** - Education apps

No more "we'll add security later" - it's built-in from the start.

A: Yes, but always review and test for your specific use case.

**Q: Does it support [specific package]?**
A: It's flexible - you can customize the generated code to use your preferred packages.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: Free and open source! AI platforms have their own pricing, but Gemini has a generous free tier.

**Q: Can I add my own PRPROMPTS?**
A: Absolutely! The system is extensible. See CONTRIBUTING.md.

## What's Next

I'm actively working on:
- Additional compliance frameworks (ISO 27001, etc.)
- More AI platform integrations
- Community-contributed PRPROMPTS
- Example projects for different industries
- VS Code extension (maybe?)
