## Post for r/FlutterDev

**Title:** [Tool] PRPROMPTS v4.4.3 - AI-Powered Flutter Development with Perfect Multi-AI Parity: From 3 Weeks to 3 Hours

**Flair:** Tool/Package

**Body:**

Hey r/FlutterDev! üëã

I've been working on solving a problem that I (and probably many of you) face constantly: the massive time sink of setting up Flutter projects with proper architecture, security, and compliance.

With v4.4.3, I've achieved something I'm particularly proud of: **ALL 21 commands now work identically** across Claude Code, Qwen Code, and Gemini CLI!

## TL;DR

**PRPROMPTS v4.4.3** is an AI-powered development framework that:
- ‚ö° Reduces setup time from weeks to hours (40-60x faster)
- üéØ **21 commands** work identically on Claude, Qwen, AND Gemini (6 PRD + 4 Planning + 5 PRPROMPTS + 6 Automation)
- üîí Includes 6 compliance frameworks (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR, SOC2, COPPA, FERPA)
- ü§ñ Choose your AI by power/cost, not by features
- üèóÔ∏è Generates Clean Architecture + BLoC structure automatically
- üì¶ Available on npm: `npm install -g prprompts-flutter-generator@4.4.3`
- üÜì 100% open source (MIT licensed)

**GitHub:** https://github.com/Kandil7/prprompts-flutter-generator

## The Problem

How many times have you done this?

1. Create new Flutter project
2. Set up folder structure (features, core, shared...)
3. Add dependencies (BLoC, dio, get_it, etc.)
4. Configure state management
5. Create base classes and interfaces
6. Set up error handling
7. Add analytics and logging
8. Implement security patterns
9. Write tests
10. Finally start building actual features

**Result:** 2-3 weeks before you write your first real feature.

Sound familiar?

## The Solution

PRPROMPTS uses a comprehensive 4-layer approach with **29 total slash commands** (21 regular + 8 skills):

### 1. PRD Creation Layer (6 Commands)
Interactive and automated PRD generation:
- `/prd:create` - Interactive wizard with **6 industry templates** (Healthcare, Fintech, Education, E-commerce, Logistics, SaaS)
- `/prd:auto-generate` - AI generates from description file
- `/prd:from-files` - Aggregate from existing docs
- `/prd:auto-from-project` - Auto-discover all project markdown files
- `/prd:analyze` - Quality scoring with **A-F grades** and AI confidence levels
- `/prd:refine` - Interactive quality improvement loop

### 2. Strategic Planning Tools (4 Commands)
NEW planning capabilities for enterprise projects:
- `/planning:estimate-cost` - Comprehensive cost breakdown (labor, infrastructure, compliance audits)
- `/planning:analyze-dependencies` - Feature dependencies and critical path mapping
- `/planning:stakeholder-review` - Role-specific PRD review checklists (Executive, Technical, Compliance, Security, Legal)
- `/planning:implementation-plan` - Sprint-based planning with velocity tracking and team allocation

### 3. 32 PRPROMPTS Generator (5 Commands)
Generate security-audited development guides:
- `/prprompts:generate-all` - All 32 PRPROMPTS files from PRD
- `/prprompts:phase-1` - Phase 1: Core Architecture (10 files)
- `/prprompts:phase-2` - Phase 2: Quality & Security (12 files)
- `/prprompts:phase-3` - Phase 3: Demo & Learning (10 files)
- `/prprompts:single-file` - Generate single file by name

Each guide follows the **PRP Pattern**:
- **FEATURE** - What it achieves
- **EXAMPLES** - Real code with actual Flutter file paths
- **CONSTRAINTS** - ‚úÖ DO / ‚ùå DON'T rules
- **VALIDATION GATES** - Pre-commit checklist + CI/CD automation
- **BEST PRACTICES** - Junior-friendly "Why?" explanations
- **REFERENCES** - Official docs, compliance guides, ADRs

### 4. Full Automation Pipeline (6 Commands)
Use these commands in Claude/Qwen/Gemini:

**`/automation:bootstrap`**
- Creates complete project structure
- Sets up all dependencies
- Configures Clean Architecture + BLoC
- Time: **~2 minutes**

**`/automation:implement-next`**
- AI implements next feature from `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Includes tests and documentation
- Follows Clean Architecture patterns
- Time: **~10 minutes per feature**

**`/automation:update-plan`**
- Adaptive re-planning based on actual velocity
- Identifies blockers and delays
- Re-allocates tasks to sprints
- Time: **~30 seconds**

**`/automation:full-cycle`**
- Auto-implement 1-10 features with dependency management
- Complete feature from scratch
- Backend + Frontend + Tests
- Time: **1-2 hours for multiple features**

**`/automation:review-commit`**
- Validates code against PRPROMPTS patterns
- Security checks
- Git commit with proper message
- Suggests improvements

**`/automation:qa-check`**
- Comprehensive quality analysis
- Architecture compliance
- Security audit
- Testing coverage check

---

## Real Example

Here's a real timeline from a healthcare app:

**Traditional approach:**
- Day 1-2: Project setup
- Day 3-7: Architecture (Clean + BLoC)
- Day 8-14: Security & HIPAA compliance
- Day 15+: Start building features
- **Total: 3+ weeks**

**With PRPROMPTS v4.4.3:**
- Minute 0-2: `/prd:create` (Healthcare app PRD with template)
- Minute 2-3: `/prprompts:generate-all` (32 guides generated)
- Minute 3-5: `/automation:bootstrap` (Complete structure)
- Minute 5-45: `/automation:implement-next` for patient records feature
- Minute 45-120: `/automation:full-cycle` for 3 more features
- **Total: ~2 hours for production-ready app with HIPAA compliance**

What you get:
‚úÖ JWT RS256 authentication
‚úÖ PHI encrypted (AES-256-GCM)
‚úÖ Audit logging
‚úÖ 85% test coverage
‚úÖ HIPAA compliant

Yes, seriously. **2 hours vs 3 weeks** = 40-60x faster!

## AI Platform Support - Perfect Command Parity

**NEW in v4.4.3:** All 21 commands work identically across all 3 platforms!

Works seamlessly with:

**üîµ Claude Code** (Anthropic)
- Best for: Production quality
- Accuracy: 9.5/10
- Context: 200K tokens
- **ALL 21 commands** ‚úÖ

**üü† Qwen Code** (Alibaba)
- Best for: Large projects
- Context: 256K-1M tokens
- Great for complex apps
- **ALL 21 commands** ‚úÖ

**üü¢ Gemini CLI** (Google)

All extensions install automatically via `npm install`.

**v4.4.3 Achievement:** Fixed Qwen & Gemini to show all 21 regular commands (not just 8 skills). Auto-generated TOML command files for perfect parity. Choose your AI by power/cost, not by features!

---

## Security & Compliance

Every PRPROMPTS includes patterns for:

- ‚úÖ **HIPAA** - Healthcare apps (PHI encryption, audit logging)
- ‚úÖ **PCI-DSS** - Payment processing (NEVER store card numbers, use tokenization)
- ‚úÖ **GDPR** - EU privacy (data portability, right to erasure)
- ‚úÖ **SOC2** - Enterprise security (access controls, monitoring)
- ‚úÖ **COPPA** - Children's apps (parental consent, data minimization)
- ‚úÖ **FERPA** - Education apps (student data protection)

No more "we'll add security later" - it's built-in from the start.

**Security-First Patterns:**
- JWT verification (NOT signing) - Flutter only verifies with public key (RS256)
- Payment tokenization - Never store full card numbers
- Encryption at rest (AES-256-GCM) and in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Audit logging for all sensitive data access
- Session management with automatic timeouts

## Comment Response Templates

**When someone asks about specific AI:**
"Great question! With v4.4.3, all 21 commands work identically across Claude Code, Qwen Code, and Gemini CLI. I spent a lot of effort achieving perfect parity - you can now choose your AI based on your needs (accuracy, context size, pricing) rather than feature availability. The TOML fix ensures everything just works!"

**When someone asks about getting started:**
"Super easy! Just run:
```bash
npm install -g prprompts-flutter-generator@4.4.3
prprompts create  # Choose from 6 industry templates
prprompts generate  # Generates 32 guides
```
Then all 29 slash commands are available in your AI of choice. The healthcare template is particularly popular - gets you HIPAA compliance out of the box!"

**When someone asks about specific compliance:**
"PRPROMPTS v4.4.3 includes built-in patterns for 6 compliance frameworks:
- HIPAA (Healthcare) - PHI encryption, audit logging
- PCI-DSS (Payments) - NEVER store cards, tokenization only
- GDPR (Privacy) - data portability, right to erasure
- SOC2 (Enterprise) - access controls, monitoring
- COPPA (Children's apps) - parental consent
- FERPA (Education) - student data protection

Each PRPROMPTS file adapts to your PRD's compliance requirements automatically. Which framework are you working with?"

**When someone shares their results:**
"Awesome results! üéâ This is exactly what I hoped to see. Would you be open to sharing a brief case study? I'm collecting real-world examples to help others. Feel free to open a GitHub discussion or DM me. Also curious - which AI did you use (Claude/Qwen/Gemini)?"

**When someone asks about the v4.4.3 fix:**
"Good eye! Before v4.4.3, Qwen Code and Gemini CLI only showed the 8 skills, not the 21 regular commands. The issue was that they require .toml file format for commands, while we only had .md files.

In v4.4.3, I added auto-generation scripts that convert all 21 markdown commands to TOML format during npm install. Now all platforms show all 29 slash commands identically. You can see the implementation in `scripts/generate-qwen-command-toml.js` and `scripts/generate-gemini-command-toml.js`!"

**When someone criticizes AI-generated code:**
"Valid concern! A few points:
1. PRPROMPTS generates *guides*, not direct code (though automation can implement)
2. Claude Code achieves 9.5/10 accuracy in my testing
3. All generated code includes 85%+ test coverage
4. Security patterns are audited and compliance-ready
5. You should ALWAYS review and test for your use case

Think of it as a very experienced senior dev pair programming with you, not a replacement for your judgment!"
