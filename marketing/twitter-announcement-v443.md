## Tweet 2/10 (The Problem)
⏰ Traditional Flutter development:
- 2-3 weeks for basic app structure
- Manual security implementation
- Repetitive boilerplate code
- Inconsistent architecture
- Compliance headaches (HIPAA, PCI-DSS)

There had to be a better way...

## Tweet 3/10 (The Solution)
💡 PRPROMPTS v4.4.3 solves this with:

📋 AI-assisted PRD creation (6 commands)
📊 Strategic planning tools (4 commands)
🤖 32 security-audited guides (5 generators)
⚡ Full automation pipeline (6 commands)
🎯 2-3 HOURS from idea to production-ready app

**Total: 21 commands working identically across all 3 AIs**
