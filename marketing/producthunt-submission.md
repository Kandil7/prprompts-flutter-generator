## Full Description

### The Problem
Traditional Flutter development is painfully slow:
- 2-3 weeks just for project setup and architecture

PRPROMPTS v4.0 is an AI-powered development framework that reduces Flutter development time from weeks to hours through intelligent automation.

### How It Works

**1. PRD Creation (2 minutes)**
Create your Product Requirements Document using:
- Interactive wizard

**3. v4.0 Automation Pipeline (NEW!)**
Five powerful commands for zero-touch development:
- `/prp-bootstrap` - Complete project structure (5 min)
- `/prp-implement-next` - AI implements next feature
- `/prp-full-cycle` - End-to-end feature development
- `/prp-review-and-commit` - Auto code review + Git
- `/prp-qa-check` - Comprehensive quality analysis

Hey Product Hunt! üëã

I'm excited to launch PRPROMPTS v4.0 today!

**The Story:**

I built this because I was tired of spending 2-3 weeks setting up Flutter projects with proper architecture, security, and compliance before I could start building actual features.

PRPROMPTS started as a personal tool to generate development guides. With v4.0, it's become a complete automation framework that works with Claude, Qwen, and Gemini AI.

**What Makes It Special:**

1. **Security-First**: Every guide includes compliance patterns (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR, etc.). No more "we'll add security later."

2. **Multi-AI**: Works with your favorite AI assistant. Not locked into one platform.

3. **Real Automation**: v4.0's automation pipeline actually implements features, not just generates boilerplate.

4. **Open Source**: MIT licensed. Community-driven. Extensible.

**Real Example:**

Last week, I built a healthcare app with patient records, appointments, and billing:
- Setup: 5 minutes (`/prp-bootstrap`)
- Authentication: 30 minutes (`/prp-full-cycle`)
- Patient records: 45 minutes (`/prp-full-cycle`)
- Appointments: 40 minutes (`/prp-full-cycle`)
- Billing (PCI-DSS): 60 minutes (`/prp-full-cycle`)

**Total: ~3 hours for a production-ready, HIPAA-compliant healthcare app.**

Previously, this would have taken 3-4 weeks.

**What I'm Looking For:**

- **Feedback** on features and usability
- **Bug reports** (it's open source, contributions welcome!)
- **Use cases** I haven't thought of
- **Compliance frameworks** you need

**Special Offer:**

It's free and open source, so... just try it! üòÑ

```bash
npm install -g prprompts-flutter-generator
```

Happy to answer any questions!

P.S. - If you try it, please share what you build. I'd love to see the community's creations!

## FAQ Responses (Pre-prepared)

**Q: How is this different from code generators like Flutter CLI?**
A: Flutter CLI creates boilerplate. PRPROMPTS creates 32 comprehensive guides AND automates implementation through AI. It's AI-assisted development, not just code generation.

**Q: Does the generated code actually work?**
A: Yes! But you should always review and test for your specific needs. The guides follow best practices and include security patterns, but every app is unique.

**Q: What if I don't use AI assistants?**
A: The 32 PRPROMPTS work great as development guides even without AI. The automation is optional - you can implement manually using the guides.

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: The framework generates production-ready code structures, but you should always conduct proper testing and security audits for your specific use case.

**Q: How do you make money from this?**
A: Currently, I don't. It's open source (MIT). Future plans might include enterprise support, training, or premium features, but the core will always be free.

**Q: Can I contribute?**
A: Absolutely! It's open source. See CONTRIBUTING.md in the repo.
