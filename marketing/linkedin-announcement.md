**Revolutionizing Flutter Development: Introducing PRPROMPTS v4.0** ðŸš€

After months of development and testing, I'm excited to announce PRPROMPTS v4.0 - an AI-powered Flutter development framework that reduces development time from weeks to hours.

**The Challenge We Solved:**

Traditional Flutter development requires extensive manual work:
- 2-3 weeks to set up proper architecture
- Manual implementation of security patterns
- Repetitive compliance configurations (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR)
- Inconsistent code quality across teams
- Limited automation in the development workflow

**Our Solution:**

PRPROMPTS v4.0 introduces a three-layer automation system:

**1. Intelligent PRD Creation**
- Interactive wizard for structured requirements
- AI-assisted auto-generation from descriptions
- Multi-file aggregation for complex projects

**2. 32 Security-Audited Development Guides**
Each guide follows our PRP (Purpose â†’ Requirements â†’ Prompt â†’ Response â†’ Validation) pattern, ensuring:
- Consistent architecture (Clean Architecture + BLoC)
- Built-in security compliance
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure
- Production-ready code from day one

**3. v4.0 Automation Pipeline (NEW!)**
Five powerful automation commands:
- `/prp-bootstrap` - Complete project structure in minutes
- `/prp-implement-next` - AI-driven feature implementation
- `/prp-full-cycle` - End-to-end feature development
- `/prp-review-and-commit` - Automated code review and Git integration
- `/prp-qa-check` - Comprehensive quality analysis

**Multi-AI Support:**

PRPROMPTS works seamlessly with three leading AI platforms:

ðŸ”µ **Claude Code** - Production-quality implementation (9.5/10 accuracy)
ðŸŸ  **Qwen Code** - Extended context for large projects (256K-1M tokens)
ðŸŸ¢ **Gemini CLI** - Generous free tier for rapid prototyping (60 req/min)

All extensions install automatically via npm.

**Real-World Impact:**

- **Time Savings**: 40-60x faster development (weeks â†’ 2-3 hours)
- **Security-First**: 6 compliance frameworks built-in (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR, SOC2, COPPA, FERPA)
- **Quality**: Automated testing, code review, and QA checks
- **Consistency**: Same architecture across all projects

**Getting Started:**

```bash
npm install -g prprompts-flutter-generator
prprompts create      # Create your PRD
prprompts generate    # Generate 32 development guides
```

**Technical Architecture:**

For the developers who want to dive deeper:
- Clean Architecture with BLoC pattern
- Comprehensive test coverage setup
- API integration scaffolding
- Analytics and monitoring infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Environment management

**Open Source & MIT Licensed:**
