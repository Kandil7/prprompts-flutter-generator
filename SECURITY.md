## Security Best Practices

### For PRPROMPTS Users

When using PRPROMPTS, follow these security best practices:

#### 1. Keep Updated

```bash
# Check for updates
npm outdated -g prprompts-flutter-generator

# Update to latest version
npm update -g prprompts-flutter-generator
```

#### 2. Verify Installation

```bash
# Check installed version
prprompts --version

# Run health check
prprompts doctor
```

#### 3. Review Generated Code

Always review AI-generated code before deploying:
- Check for hardcoded secrets
- Verify security implementations
- Test authentication/authorization
- Validate input handling
- Review encryption usage

#### 4. Protect PRD Files

PRD files may contain sensitive information:
- Don't commit PRDs with sensitive data to public repos
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude `docs/PRD.md` if needed
- Sanitize PRDs before sharing

```bash
# Add to .gitignore
echo "docs/PRD.md" >> .gitignore
```

#### 5. Extension Security

When installing AI extensions:
- Only install from official sources
- Verify checksums if provided
- Review extension permissions
- Keep extensions updated

## Security Features

PRPROMPTS includes several security-focused features:

### 1. Security-First Architecture

All generated code follows security best practices:
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated
- **Output Encoding**: XSS prevention
- **Authentication**: Secure auth patterns
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Encryption**: Data encryption at rest and in transit

### 2. Compliance Support

PRPROMPTS supports multiple compliance standards:
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data protection
- **PCI-DSS**: Payment card security
- **FERPA**: Education records privacy
- **GDPR**: EU data protection
- **SOC2**: Enterprise security

### 3. Audit Logging

Generated code includes audit logging for:
- User actions
- Data access
- Authentication events
- Configuration changes

Example:
```dart
await auditLogger.log(
  action: AuditAction.patientView,
  userId: currentUser.id,
  resourceId: patientId,
  resourceType: 'Patient',
  details: 'Patient record accessed',
);
```

### 4. Encryption Patterns

Secure encryption implementations:
```dart
// PHI encryption (HIPAA)
@JsonKey(fromJson: _decryptString, toJson: _encryptString)
required String ssn,

// AES-256-GCM encryption
final encrypted = await EncryptionService.encrypt(
  plaintext: sensitiveData,
  keyId: 'patient-data-key',
);
```

### 5. Secure Storage

```dart
// Secure local storage
await secureStorage.write(
  key: 'auth_token',
  value: token,
);

// Never use plain SharedPreferences for sensitive data
// ‚ùå await prefs.setString('token', token);
```


### 6. API Key Management

PRPROMPTS integrates with AI provider CLIs (Claude Code, Qwen Code, Gemini CLI) that require API keys for authentication.

#### Getting API Keys

**Claude Code (Anthropic):**
- Console: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
- Documentation: https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs
- Authentication: Uses `~/.config/claude/config.json` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable

**Qwen Code (Alibaba Cloud):**
- Console: https://dashscope.aliyun.com/
- Documentation: https://help.aliyun.com/zh/dashscope/
- Authentication: Uses `~/.config/qwen/config.json` or `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` environment variable

**Gemini CLI (Google):**
- Console: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
- Documentation: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs
- Authentication: Uses `~/.config/gemini/config.json` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable

#### Secure API Key Storage

**‚úÖ Best Practices:**

1. **Use Environment Variables** (recommended for development):
   ```bash
   # Copy the template
   cp .env.example .env

   # Add your keys
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxxxx
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyxxxxx
   DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-xxxxx
   ```

2. **Use CLI Authentication** (alternative):
   ```bash
   # Authenticate via CLI (stores in ~/.config/{ai}/config.json)
   claude auth login
   qwen auth login
   gemini auth login
   ```

3. **Use Secret Management Systems** (production):
   - AWS Secrets Manager
   - Azure Key Vault
   - Google Secret Manager
   - HashiCorp Vault
   - 1Password CLI / Bitwarden CLI

4. **Separate Keys by Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Development
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-dev-xxxxx

   # Production (use secret manager, not .env)
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-prod-xxxxx
   ```

**‚ùå Never Do This:**

1. **Don't commit API keys to version control**:
   ```bash
   # ‚ùå BAD - hardcoded in code
   const apiKey = "sk-ant-api03-xxxxx";

   # ‚ùå BAD - committed .env file
   git add .env

   # ‚úÖ GOOD - use .env.example template
   git add .env.example
   ```

2. **Don't expose keys in logs or errors**:
   ```javascript
   // ‚ùå BAD
   console.log(`Using API key: ${process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}`);

   // ‚úÖ GOOD
   console.log(`API key configured: ${!!process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}`);
   ```

3. **Don't share keys in issues, PRs, or chat**:
   - If you need to share logs, redact API keys first
   - Use `[REDACTED]` or `sk-ant-***` placeholders

4. **Don't use production keys in development**:
   - Create separate keys for dev, staging, and production
   - Use minimal permissions for each environment

#### Key Rotation

**Recommended Schedule:**
- **Development keys**: Rotate every 90 days
- **Production keys**: Rotate every 30-60 days
- **Compromised keys**: Revoke immediately

**Rotation Process:**
```bash
# 1. Generate new key in provider console
# 2. Update environment variables
# 3. Test with new key
# 4. Revoke old key
# 5. Update documentation
```

#### Incident Response: Leaked API Key

If you accidentally commit an API key to version control:

**üö® Immediate Actions (within 5 minutes):**

1. **Revoke the key immediately** in the provider console:
   - Claude: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
   - Gemini: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
   - Qwen: https://dashscope.aliyun.com/

2. **Generate a new key** and update your `.env` file

3. **Test** that the new key works:
   ```bash
   prprompts doctor
   claude --version
   ```

**üîß Cleanup Actions (within 1 hour):**

4. **Remove the key from git history**:
   ```bash
   # Using git-filter-repo (recommended)
   git filter-repo --invert-paths --path .env

   # Or using BFG Repo-Cleaner
   bfg --replace-text passwords.txt

   # Force push (if working alone)
   git push origin --force --all
   ```

5. **Notify your team** if the repository is shared

6. **Check provider logs** for unauthorized usage

7. **Update incident log** with details for future reference

**üìù Prevention:**

- Enable pre-commit hooks to detect secrets:
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev @commitlint/cli
  # Add to .git/hooks/pre-commit
  ```
- Use tools like `git-secrets`, `truffleHog`, or `detect-secrets`
- Review `.gitignore` to ensure `.env` is excluded (already configured)

#### Monitoring API Usage

**Detect Anomalies:**
- Monitor API usage in provider consoles
- Set up billing alerts for unexpected usage spikes
- Review access logs regularly

**Signs of Compromised Keys:**
- Unexpected API calls from unknown IPs
- Usage spikes at unusual times
- Quota exceeded errors
- Billing anomalies

**If you suspect compromise:**
1. Revoke the key immediately
2. Generate new key
3. Review provider access logs
4. Check git history for leaks
5. Audit all systems using that key

## Known Security Considerations

### 1. AI-Generated Code

PRPROMPTS uses AI to generate code. While we strive for security:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Always review** generated code before production use
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Test thoroughly** especially authentication and data handling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Verify compliance** implementations meet your requirements

### 2. Template Injection

PRD files are processed as templates:
- Don't process untrusted PRD files
- Sanitize any user-provided PRD content
- Use official examples as templates

### 3. Extension Permissions

AI extensions have access to your codebase:
- Only install official extensions
- Review extension code if concerned
- Keep extensions updated

### 4. Dependency Security

PRPROMPTS has minimal dependencies, but:
- We monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities
- We update dependencies regularly
- Run `npm audit` to check your installation

```bash
npm audit
```
