# Upload to GitHub Instructions

Your project has been created and is ready to upload! Here are two methods to complete the upload:

## Method 1: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)

### Step 1: Authenticate with GitHub
```bash
cd K:/tools/cli-tools/prprompts-flutter-generator
gh auth login
```

Follow the prompts to authenticate (choose "GitHub.com", "HTTPS", and "Login with a web browser").

### Step 2: Create Repository and Push
```bash
gh repo create prprompts-flutter-generator \
  --public \
  --source=. \
  --remote=origin \
  --description="Generate customized PRPROMPTS for Flutter projects from PRD - HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR compliant" \
  --push
```

This will:
- Create a public repository named "prprompts-flutter-generator" under your account (Kandil7)
- Add it as the origin remote
- Push all committed files

### Step 3: Configure Repository Settings
```bash
# Add topics
gh repo edit --add-topic flutter,claude-code,clean-architecture,bloc,hipaa,pci-dss,compliance

# Enable discussions
gh repo edit --enable-discussions

# Enable issues (should be enabled by default)
gh repo edit --enable-issues
```
