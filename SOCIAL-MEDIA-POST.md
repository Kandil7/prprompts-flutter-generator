**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
🚀 I just built a production-ready, HIPAA-compliant Flutter app in 2 hours (not days!)

How? Meet PRPROMPTS v4.0 - AI-powered automation that goes from PRD to working code automatically.

Thread 🧵👇

**Tweet 2 (Problem):**
Flutter development is broken:
❌ 3-5 days just for project setup
❌ Security vulnerabilities everywhere
❌ 6+ months to onboard junior devs
❌ $50K+ fines for compliance violations

There's a better way...

**Tweet 3 (Solution):**
PRPROMPTS transforms your Product Requirements Document into:
✅ 32 security-audited development guides
✅ Complete project structure
✅ Auto-implemented features with tests
✅ HIPAA/PCI-DSS/GDPR compliance

In 2-3 hours, not days.

**Tweet 4 (v4.0 Automation):**
NEW in v4.0: Full automation with 5 commands:

/bootstrap-from-prprompts → Complete setup (2 min)
/implement-next → Auto-implement features (10 min each)
/full-cycle → Implement 1-10 features automatically
/review-and-commit → Validate & commit
/qa-check → Compliance audit

**Tweet 5 (Real Example):**
Real example - Healthcare app:

Manual way: 3-5 days
PRPROMPTS way: 2 hours

What you get:
✅ JWT RS256 authentication
✅ PHI encrypted (AES-256-GCM)
✅ Audit logging
✅ 85% test coverage
✅ HIPAA compliant

Speed-up: 40-60x faster!

**Tweet 6 (Security):**
Security built-in prevents these common mistakes:

❌ JWT signing in Flutter (exposes secrets)
❌ Storing credit cards (PCI-DSS violation)
❌ Logging PHI (HIPAA violation)

PRPROMPTS ensures you do it right the first time.

**Tweet 7 (Installation):**
Getting started is stupid simple:

```bash
npm install -g prprompts-flutter-generator
prprompts auto && prprompts generate
claude
/full-cycle
10
```

30 seconds to install, 2 hours to production app.

**Tweet 8 (Success Story):**
Startup used PRPROMPTS to build their MVP in 1 week (vs 8-12 weeks estimated).

Result:
💰 $75K saved
✅ 95% test coverage
🔒 HIPAA compliant
📈 Secured $2M Series A

All because they could demo a working, secure app.

**Title:** How We Built a HIPAA-Compliant Flutter App in 2 Hours (Not Days) with AI Automation

**Body:**

The problem with Flutter development today:

Most teams spend 3-5 days just setting up a production-ready project. Then another 2-4 weeks training junior developers. Security vulnerabilities slip through. Compliance requirements are missed. Costs spiral.

There's a better way.

**Introducing PRPROMPTS v4.0**

An open-source CLI tool that:
1. Analyzes your Product Requirements Document
2. Generates 32 customized, security-audited development guides
3. AUTO-IMPLEMENTS your entire app with AI automation
4. Ensures HIPAA/PCI-DSS/GDPR compliance
5. Generates comprehensive tests (85%+ coverage)

**Real Results:**

🏥 **Healthcare Startup** - Built HIPAA-compliant MVP in 1 week (vs 8-12 weeks), saved $75K, secured $2M funding

🏦 **Fortune 500 Bank** - Zero security vulnerabilities in 6-month audit, 40% faster developer onboarding

👩‍💻 **Solo Developer** - Launched app in 72 hours, now making $12K MRR

**How It Works:**

```bash
# Install (30 seconds)
npm install -g prprompts-flutter-generator

# Generate guides (60 seconds)
prprompts auto && prprompts generate

# Auto-implement (2 hours)
/bootstrap-from-prprompts
/full-cycle
10
/qa-check
```

**What Makes It Special:**

✅ **Security-First** - Prevents 15+ common vulnerabilities
✅ **Compliance-Aware** - 6 standards supported
✅ **AI-Powered** - 40-60x faster than manual development
✅ **Junior-Friendly** - Explains "why" behind every pattern
✅ **Production-Ready** - Clean Architecture, 85%+ test coverage

**The Impact:**

This isn't just about speed. It's about:
- Making enterprise-grade security accessible to everyone
- Reducing compliance costs from $50K+ to $0
- Empowering solo developers to compete with funded teams
- Helping teams ship secure apps without security experts

**Open Source & Free**

## Reddit Post (r/FlutterDev)

**Title:** [Tool] I built PRPROMPTS v4.0 - Go from PRD to production Flutter app in 2 hours with AI automation (Open Source)

**Body:**

Hey r/FlutterDev!

I've been working on **PRPROMPTS** for the past year, and v4.0 just launched with full AI automation. Thought you might find it useful.

**What is PRPROMPTS?**

TL;DR: Give it your Product Requirements Document, it generates 32 customized development guides + auto-implements your entire app with tests.

**The Problem I Was Solving:**

Every Flutter project I worked on had the same issues:
- 3-5 days just setting up the project structure
- Security vulnerabilities (JWT signing in Flutter, storing credit cards, etc.)
- Missing compliance documentation (HIPAA, PCI-DSS violations discovered late)
- Junior developers struggling without context

**How PRPROMPTS Works:**

1. **Analyze your PRD** (1-5 minutes to create)
2. **Generate 32 guides** (60 seconds)
3. **Auto-implement with v4.0** (2-3 hours)

**v4.0 Automation Commands:**

- `/bootstrap-from-prprompts` - Complete project setup (2 min)
- `/implement-next` - Auto-implement any feature (10 min)
- `/full-cycle` - Implement 1-10 features automatically
- `/review-and-commit` - Validate & commit
- `/qa-check` - Compliance audit with detailed report

**Real Example - Healthcare App:**

```bash
# Install
npm install -g prprompts-flutter-generator @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Generate PRPROMPTS
cp templates/healthcare.md project_description.md
prprompts auto && prprompts generate

# Auto-implement
claude
/bootstrap-from-prprompts
/full-cycle
12
/qa-check
```

**What You Get (2 hours later):**

✅ JWT RS256 authentication (public key verification)
✅ PHI encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM)
✅ Audit logging for all PHI access
✅ Clean Architecture with BLoC
✅ Material 3 design system
✅ 85%+ test coverage
✅ HIPAA compliance checklist
✅ Zero security vulnerabilities

**Security Patterns Built-In:**

The tool prevents common mistakes like:
- ❌ JWT signing in Flutter (exposes private keys)
- ❌ Storing credit cards (PCI-DSS violation)
- ❌ Logging PHI (HIPAA violation)

Every pattern is security-audited and explained with "why".

**Compliance Support:**

- HIPAA (Healthcare)
- PCI-DSS (Payments)
- GDPR (EU users)
- SOC2 (Enterprise)
- COPPA (Children)
- FERPA (Education)

**Works With:**

- Claude Code (best accuracy)
- Qwen Code (best for large codebases)
- Gemini CLI (best free tier)

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install -g prprompts-flutter-generator
```

**Links:**

- 📦 npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/prprompts-flutter-generator
- 🐙 GitHub: https://github.com/Kandil7/prprompts-flutter-generator
- 📖 Full docs in README

**License:** MIT (free for commercial use)

## Dev.to Article (Shorter Version)

**Title:** PRPROMPTS v4.0: Build Production Flutter Apps in 2 Hours with AI Automation

**Tags:** #flutter #ai #automation #opensource #security

**Body:**

I just shipped v4.0 of PRPROMPTS - an open-source tool that goes from Product Requirements Document to production Flutter app in 2-3 hours (not days).

**The Problem**

Most Flutter projects take 3-5 days just for setup:
- Configure folder structure
- Set up security patterns
- Create design system
- Write boilerplate

Then you discover security issues in production. 💸

**The Solution**

PRPROMPTS analyzes your PRD and:
1. Generates 32 security-audited development guides
2. AUTO-IMPLEMENTS everything with v4.0 automation
3. Ensures HIPAA/PCI-DSS/GDPR compliance
4. Creates comprehensive tests (85%+ coverage)

**Quick Example**

```bash
# Install
npm install -g prprompts-flutter-generator

# Generate guides
prprompts auto && prprompts generate

# Auto-implement
claude  # or qwen/gemini
/bootstrap-from-prprompts
/full-cycle
10
/qa-check
```

**What Gets Automated**

✅ Project structure (Clean Architecture)
✅ Security infrastructure (JWT, encryption)
✅ Design system (Material 3)
✅ Feature implementation
✅ Comprehensive tests
✅ Code review & commits
✅ Compliance audit

**Real Results**

- Healthcare startup: MVP in 1 week (vs 8-12 weeks)
- Fortune 500 bank: Zero security issues in audit
- Solo dev: App Store launch in 72 hours

**Security Built-In**

Prevents these common mistakes:
- JWT signing in Flutter (exposes secrets)
- Storing credit cards (PCI-DSS violation)
- Logging sensitive data (HIPAA violation)

**URL:** https://github.com/Kandil7/prprompts-flutter-generator

**Comment to post:**

Author here!

PRPROMPTS started as a way to solve a personal problem: every Flutter project I worked on had the same security vulnerabilities (JWT signing in client code, storing credit cards, logging PII).

v4.0 introduces full AI automation - you can now go from Product Requirements Document to working, tested, compliant code in 2-3 hours.

**How it works:**

1. Analyze your PRD (detects HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR requirements)
2. Generate 32 customized development guides (security patterns, compliance checklists)
3. Auto-implement with 5 AI commands (/bootstrap, /implement-next, /full-cycle, etc.)

**Real usage:**

A healthcare startup used it to build their HIPAA-compliant MVP in 1 week (vs 8-12 weeks estimated). They passed the security audit first try and secured $2M in funding based on the demo.

**Tech stack:**

- Node.js CLI
- Works with Claude Code, Qwen Code, Gemini CLI
- Generates Flutter code (Clean Architecture + BLoC)
- MIT licensed

**What makes it different:**
